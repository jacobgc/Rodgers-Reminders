# Requirements Specification

## Evaluating the computing and business needs of Rodgers Reminders

### The services the organisation provides
The Rodgers Reminders IOS application is being created to fill a gap in the market for a decent reminders, application. Many applications do some features and then other applications do others. This app is going to encompass them all within one application. Below is a basic list of some of the features that this IOS Application will include.

Key = (Tick = Easy feature to implement, No Tick = Hard feature to implement)
- [ ] Login System (Username/Password, Social login, Active directory login (Enterprise use))
- [x] Reminders (Goal based, time based)
- [x] Calander events
- [X] Alerts via notification and email
- [X] Native application (not web based)

### The Aims and goals of the organisation
The aim of the organisation is to create a final solution for reminder applications, hopefully, this application will include every feature that users need. The application will include a feature request form that will allow users to request features that they require.

### The customer's needs, expectations and how the app will be delivered
The customer requires a very well built IOS application that gives the ability for reminders to be created however a user wants and to be able to notify the user if so required. The app will be delivered using a continuous integration system that will allow updates to be pushed automatically to the end user every week. This will allow the client to not need to worry about updates as it will be handled by the CI system.

### The staff's needs, working styles and patterns
The staff's needs will be somewhere pleasant to work, whether that be in an office or in their own home and work remotely, which is becoming a big trend in software development. Staff will also need to be in teams so they don't feel like all of the work is on them and they also need colleagues they can go to for advice on issues they are having. Staff should also be able to use flexi-hours which will allow them, within reason, to work when they want to work, rather than being forced into set schedules.

### Location of staff, customers, premises, market/service

## Evaluating the factors affecting the success and failure of the new IOS application in regards to the following

### The risk associated with completion of tasks on time and within budget
Creating an application comes with many risks, the main issue is budget. Most applications fail because the company behind them or the client asking for the application runs out of money to keep the development going. This can be mitigated against by conducting a thorough requirements specification and analysing every feature to ensure that the budget encompasses it and that there is enough time for that feature to be completed.

### Costs and time constraints
*Did I not just cover that above?*
*Talk about different teams falling behind causing other teams to fall behind due to other work not being completed*

### Staff skills and the maintenance of the IOS application
The staff will all require different skills depending on which team they are in. Analysts will need to be analytic, designers will need to be good at designing and programmers will need skills in Swift and or other programming languages associated with IOS development.
